## Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost global cause of mortality, claiming approximately 17.9 million lives in 2019. These diseases, which include heart attacks and strokes, accounted for 85% of CVD-related fatalities. In this study, Bayesian Networks (BNs) are employed for the early detection of CVDs, with a focus on validating the predictive efficacy of various BNs and exploring the intricate interactions among diverse risk factors. Our research emphasizes the importance of balancing data-driven optimization with domain knowledge for meaningful and effective CVD prediction. The study found that the BN built upon domain knowledge demonstrates remarkable predictive performance, highlighting its potential for meaningful and effective CVD prediction.
